# Questions

Here I put all of life's interesting questions.  Well, at least all the questions I have that need someone else's input. Typically I'll put their name in front of the question, so they know it's to them.  If your name is here, I'm talking to you chump!  Seriously though, these are some questions that need answers.

- [ ] Ask Beag/Bolide about what the exact names of the command syntax should be:

    >1. +command/action lh.Target/lh.action = rh.Target/rh.action
    >
    >2. +command/verb lh.noun/lh.verb = rh.noun/rh.verb
    >
    >3. something else?

- [ ] Beag/Bolide How often do you guys use the +jgroups functionality of the jobs system?

- [ ] Beag - You said you wanted a seperate repo for the project development.  Should I just continue under pegasus and add Bolide as a contrib, should we keep it as a port Repo on EmblemOfEa's git, or should we create a completely new account with a new repo?
