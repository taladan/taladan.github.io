##### Current progress:
* 04-07-18, (18:52) - testing suite setUp, tearDown, `Job().create` pass/fail tests complete

---

* 04-09-18, (21:44) - Dev environment bellerophon set up for primary development.
                      set up some preliminary test stuff for `CmdJobs().create` but it is not
                      working yet.  I'm hoping now that I've got the primary development enviroment
                      set up, I can speed up a little.

---

* 04-09-18, (22:20) - Outline todo list for next session.  Started planning outline for Bucket/CmdBucket recode

---

* 04-10-18, (11:56) - Gathered list of functions that currently exist within the scope of the jobs system.  Marked the few that I've worked on thus far, and organized my todo list accordingly.  Started some on refactoring buckets - `world.utilities.pegasus_utilities.py` is now a thing, and currently the only (TESTED!) method in there is hash - this will take two different types of strings (though they can be identical strings) and return a unique hash of those strings as an md5().hexdigest() string.  Centralized this so that all systems under pegasus can access the hash functionality if it needs to without having to do any spooky voodoo with requiring cross-system utilities.

* 04-12-18, (08:26) - Yesterday I posted on reddit and got some good response about how to become a better programmer.  If I keep using this as a blogging stage, I might have to set up a blog to work on - I find it helps me think to spitball in this type of forum.  So, there's been a few people expressing interest about helping with the project, this morning I'm going to be working on updating Standards on the wiki, refining what contributors need to do to get spun up with programming Pegasus - we're going to need some tutorials folks.  If I can get through that, I'd like to be doing some actual code work by noon :p.

* 04-12-18, (12:11) - Finished [The Code Contributor's Manifesto](Contributor) as well as updating some of the [PSC](https://github.com/taladan/Pegasus/wiki/PSC----Pegasus-Style-Convention)

---

* 04-15-18, (12:12) - Yesterday we worked on some stuff for the bucket recode.  I've decided that I am going to try out a menu driven system to see if the interface is a little easier to navigate as well as dealing with the entry of the variables on the backend into the database.  Some of the commands that exist currently on the CmdBucket file will be going away - they're not necessary and if I do decide to go back and add those commands back into the system for nostalgia's sake, it's still going to need a recode - that stuff is just manky.  

* 04-15-18, (12:14) - Today I'm going to be continuing with the CmdBucket recode.   
>- Currently I have the following methods done and waiting for testing:
>    ```
>    _get_input
>    _assign_boards
>    timeout
>    name
>    desc
>    board
>    ```
>    
>- We're going to be trying to get through these methods today:
>
>    ```
>    group
>    locked
>    notify
>    ```
>    
>I'd also like to get into testing of the methods in the new cmdbucket file today (and through it if we're really wanting to wish big).

04-15-18, (21:04) - Need to work on logging - check `world.utilties.pegasus_utilties.log` - Have to figure out a way to test this or we can't do special log sauce. - Tal

---

04-15-18, (22:10) - Tonight we worked on groups...may need to refactor name as groups exists in Evennia namespace already (alias to access permissions).  This shouldn't be a problem - don't want to call them 'factions' but we'll come up with a better name for it - talk to Beag, maybe she has some input.  `world.jobs.new_bucket.py` is kind of in a holding pattern until I can get groups nailed down a bit - buckets ties in with this system so I need to get at least the basic framework down before I dash on with the bucket recode.  Tomorrow I need to work on finishing the nodes in `world.groups.Group._create`. - Tal

Needed project systems

#### IRC Bots
Need a couple of these - working on setting one up to auto notify of pushes/requests to git
(idea )Would like one to transmit messages from #pegasus-project to twitch chat channel and vice versa.


Functionality to test
===


#### Bucket Recode

- [ ] \* Maintain functionality of bucket
- [x] Gather inventory of functions
- [ ] \* Clean documentation
- [ ] \* Refactor internal functionality
- [ ] Refactor CmdBuckets functionality
   
   
I think I want to do a menu based system for bucket creation instead of the seperate commands and switches.  It's a pain in the arse to have to recode, but I think it will simplify matters greatly both with creation and with handling the data on the back end.  Right now the data creation is just too absolutely spread out and doing things like setting completion boards, timeout, etc. shouldn't be optional...it should be included, easy to do and automatic. 04-13-18, (13:56) - Tal

#### Things to remember:
* [cmdset_mergetype](https://github.com/evennia/evennia/wiki/EvMenu) - This should control blocking within the menu system - may need to be able to implement submenus that block and release control back when they've executed.  If X then block_submenu(), else submenu().  Could use an @decorator for this possibly?? 


Jobs needs a status list - states of being for the job - this will live on self.db.status, as a string value to be matched against a list of statuses.  Not able to be set by outside influence. 04-13-18, (14:04) - Tal
