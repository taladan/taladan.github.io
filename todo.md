All settings files should have a SYSTEM variable that holds which system it's part of.

#### Jobs test suite *
* Jobs *
    - syntax to remember:
    > `super(CommandTest, self).setUp()`
    > `self.assertIsequal()`
    > `self.call(command, "", "expected return")`

##### Current progress:
* 04-07-18, (18:52) - testing suite setUp, tearDown, `Job().create` pass/fail tests complete

---

* 04-09-18, (21:44) - Dev environment bellerophon set up for primary development.
                      set up some preliminary test stuff for `CmdJobs().create` but it is not
                      working yet.  I'm hoping now that I've got the primary development enviroment
                      set up, I can speed up a little.
